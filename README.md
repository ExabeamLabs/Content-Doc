# Exabeam Content Library
Welcome to the Exabeam Content Library.

The Content Library is an online repository of knowledge and content that organizations can use to deploy new use cases. The initial release allows customers to quickly map data sources to security use cases and to download the necessary parsers.

This is a programmatic generation of content documentation from Exabeam's content repository. As new content is committed to the content repository, the Content Library is automatically updated to provide fast and easy access.

### [Content "master" branch - latest "canary" content available]
- [Exabeam supported use cases](CDS_Tool_Output/master/Exabeam%20Use%20Cases.md)
  - Navigating from Exabeam use case to data source
- [Exabeam supported data sources](CDS_Tool_Output/master/Exabeam%20Data%20Sources.md)
  - Navigating from data source to use case
### [Content "c1907" branch - shipped with Advanced Analytics i52.7]
- [Exabeam supported use cases](CDS_Tool_Output/c1907/Exabeam%20Use%20Cases.md)
  - Navigating from Exabeam use case to data source
- [Exabeam supported data sources](CDS_Tool_Output/c1907/Exabeam%20Data%20Sources.md)
  - Navigating from data source to use case

## How do I use it?
The Content Library provides navigation from an Exabeam supported data source to a use case (or use case to data source) showing the event types and parsers for each.

The Content Library currently allows browsing two Exabeam content branches: 
 - Content "c1907" branch: The content repository shipped with the latest version of Advanced Analytics i52.7
 - Content "master" branch: The master repository of all the latest content developed by the Exabeam content team

Browse the c1907 branch to see the documentation for the content that is available in the product today (Advanced Analytics i52.7) or browse the master repository for a peek into what is coming next ("canary" content). Note that the content in the master may not be QA'd as of yet and should be used carefully. 

## How can it help me?
The Content Library helps answer some of the most frequently asked questions regarding Exabeam's rich security content:

 - What use cases does Exabeam content support out of the box?
   - What are the data sources that can be used to get that content to function? 
   - What are the components of Exabeam content that enable that use case?

 - What data sources does Exabeam support out of the box?
   - What use case(s) does that content enable?
   - What are the components of Exabeam content that are enabled by a data source integration?
